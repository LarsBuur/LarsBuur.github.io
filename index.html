                <p>I am an Internet professional with 19 years’ experience of software engineering, web programming and ecommerce consulting.</p>
                <p>
                    I have built two companies that made a difference and helped hundreds of companies with their web-related challenges, ranging from top 100 US companies to one-person shops just starting out.

                    In late 1996, I started Snabel &amp; Co in Copenhagen. We were a “normal” web agency and we built static and dynamic web pages for huge Danish companies and institutions. We quickly decided to build a back-end system to enable editors to maintain the content on their websites. This later became known as a CMS. We built a product called “Site In A Box” and it was the first CMS in Denmark.</p>
                <p>
                    Read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990914092456/http://www.snabel.com/kunder.asp?year=98">the wayback machine: </a> and <a href="http://umbraco.com/about-us/history">Umbraco history pages </a>
                </p>
                <p>I sold Snabel &amp; Co in 1999 due to some irreconcilable differences with the investor group.</p>
                <p>
                    In 2003, I started Chainbox ApS, also in Copenhagen. Our main focus, from the start, was to build an ecommerce platform entirely driven by ERP data, using close to live data. This meant our customers only needed to focus on maintaining their pricing structures, the data about their products, inventory data, etc., and everything was in one place and automatic. Ecommerce orders were written back to the ERP system. After 10 years, I sold my shares to my business partner.

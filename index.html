            <p>I am an software professional with 20 years’ experience of software engineering, web programming and consulting.</p>
            <p>
                I have built two companies that made a difference and helped hundreds of companies, ranging from top 100 US companies to one-person shops just starting out. </p>

            <h3> In late 1996, I founded Snabel &amp; Co in Copenhagen.</h3>
            <p> We were a “normal” web agency and we built static and dynamic web pages for huge Danish companies and institutions. We quickly decided to build a back-end system to enable editors to maintain the content on their websites. This later became known as a CMS. We built a product called “Site In A Box” and it was the first CMS in Denmark.</p>

                <a href="http://umbraco.com/about-us/history">Umbraco history pages </a>
            </p>
            <p>I sold Snabel &amp; Co in 1999 due to some irreconcilable differences with the investors.</p>

            <h3> In 2003, I founded Chainbox ApS, also in Copenhagen.</h3>

            <p>Our main focus, from the start, was to build an ecommerce platform entirely driven by ERP data, using close to live data. This meant our customers only needed to focus on maintaining their pricing structures, the data about their products, inventory data, etc., and everything was in one place and automatic. Ecommerce orders were written back to the ERP system. </p>

                    After 10 years, I sold my shares to my business partner in January 2013. </i></p>

            <h3>In Marts 2015 I founded Cocoa Invest together with Omar Shaikh. </h3>

            <p>COCOA is an Anglo-Danish online investment service that provides intelligent diversified portfolios that are cost effective, transparent and simple to access for retail investors.</p>
            <p><i>August 2018: Omar and I did not succeed in launching the business in due time. Dealing with the Danish FSA and having troubles finding a proper banking partner was the primary problems. Omar chose to continue and I wish him good luck with that.</i></p>
            
            <h3>In August 2015 I became a partner i BandCizer ApS</h3>
            <p>The BandCizer sensor can be attached to an elastic training band which is used as the primary exercises in northern europe in rehabilitation. We can provide training and compliance data to the physiotherapist monitoring the patients. Now the physiotherapist knows if the patient is following the program set out - and the improvements made.</p>

            <h3>In August 2018 I bought half of BandCizer ApS</h3>
            <p>Together with my business partner Tim we now control the company and will be launching a sensor as-as service product in Q3 2018. </p>
